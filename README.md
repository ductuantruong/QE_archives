**<ins>Lessons I learned from preparing my QE</ins>:**
1) Structure your report and slides like a story (Introduction -> Current Problems -> Existing Solutions -> Motivation -> Proposed Methods).
2) Draw figures to summarize your literature review as well as describe your proposed methods in the report & slides.
